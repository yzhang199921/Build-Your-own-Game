- Started a little late
I began my project two days before the due date and realized it was not enough time for 
me to finish. I probably should have started a little earlier. I didn't realize
the amount of work needed. The difference between this project and the previous one 
was substantial.


- lots of conflict with other events
I had some deadlines for other courses I needed to make. In addition, I was also involved
in some extracurriculars such as a retreat as well as Fraternity businesses.
